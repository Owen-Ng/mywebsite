# mywebsite

## This will be a better version of my current web portfolio @http://website.owenng.tech/. 
## The ability of creating the same web portfolio will be available
## There will be an account registration and shareable link to be viewed only.

Here is a prototype of how it will looks like

# Registered users
## Will be able to create an account and have the same exact portfolio template? The template will not be editable. It could be used for a very quick portfolio if you do not have one.
# View only users.
## Each registered users with have their own unique link that can be shared to anyone with their current information added to it.

I am planning to encrypt everything from description to password.
